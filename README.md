## My process

It did take some weeks to complete this challenge, specially because I didn't use so much Grid Layout, so I did have to check some articles before, and fix some accessibility issues. After that I think to learn the best method to deploy typescript apps to Github Pages which makes me very happy.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Style Components with Emotion
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [TS](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html) - Language
- [React](https://es.reactjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

Setting and deploying React+Typescript projects.
Grid Layout
Smooth Scrolling (really easy btw)

### Continued development

I expect to create mobile menu modal and maybe add some interaction to the 'LEARN MORE' anchors.

### Useful resources

- [Smooth Scrolling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg9We54OxmE) - This helped me to learn how to do the smooth scrolling.
- [Deploy in GH pages](https://platzi.com/tutoriales/1548-react/4065-guia-para-usar-github-pages-en-tus-proyectos-de-reactjs/) - This helped me a lot deploying this site.
